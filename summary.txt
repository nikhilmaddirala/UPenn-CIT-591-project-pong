Project description
Our project is an implementation of the classic computer game Pong. We have enhanced it by providing a single
player mode, a two player mode, and difficulty levels that incorporate obstacles. We used PennDraw as our graphics library.
We built additional Swing components to accept user inputs and included sound to enrich the user experience.
